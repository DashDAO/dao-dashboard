Better visibility for your DAOs, your Votes and your Delegates

# The problem

Delegations are our only hope of making crypto work. To build new systems we need participation, and delegation is the best way of getting it.

The problem is delegation sucks.

Users have no way to track their delegations nor what the delegates are doing. Information is spread all over. Decision making is complex and overwhelming. UX of most tools and interfaces is very bad.

# The solution

DashDao is a tracking and alert system for delegations. Users are able to see clear and relevant DAO and delegate information, follow the delegates they want to watch closely and receive alerts related to delegate participation.

By giving the users tools to see which delegates are more active, we create a "Darwin effect". Less active delegates will lose their delegations to more active delegates and overall governance participation will therefore increase.

Additionally, it helps users pick delegates they are more aligned with, improving their sense of beloning and consecuently community engagement.
